      <h2>Why should you consider small workshops over schooling or bootcamps?</h2>
      <p>
        Learning to become a professional photographer is easier than ever. There is vast amount of resources both free and paid from college education, bootcamps as well as group workshops. Unfortunately, when information is catered toward the mass, materials are spread too far too thin. Consequently, most lessons are slower paced and simplified for diverse audiences where individual factors are not taken into considerations. The unspoken theory in real world is that fittest survive and the weakest fail. However, our one on one workshop perfectly delivers the required skills at the most appropriate pace to the individual in much efficient manner. There is no one to compete or judge your performance but yourself. Learn at your pace at your terms to elevate your standard. 
      </p>
