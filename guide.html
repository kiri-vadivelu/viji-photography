            <h1>Guide for New Clients, Photographers and Artists</h1>
            <p>
                There are plenty of photography resources available online but not all are applicable to
                everyone. Rather than repeating the existing content, we attempt to add our flavor of
                expertise into the photography universe. Please note that the following recommendations are narrated
                based on our work experience in the photography industry. We hope you would find our insights
                helpful.
                If you do, please connect with us on social media to show us your support. The following
                recommendations are geared toward new clients and
                aspiring photographers to make wise decisions and to avoid potential pitfalls. And, we would
                greatly appreciate your constructive feedbacks.

            <h2>Client: Hiring a Photographer</h2>
            <p>
                There are many options for clients when it comes to hiring a photographer. However,
                everyone market at different rate with variety of services. That makes it harder to find an
                appropriate photographer for the assignment. Meanwhile, measuring skills of one photographer with
                another is not practical and that is not the ideal strategy either. Like any other profession,
                photography
                takes time to master. Secondly, professional equipment is costly to own and maintain on top of
                studio overhead expenses.
                Meanwhile, post processing technologies have advanced over the years but image processing work
                require
                expertise skills to deliver consistent results. Pros do not get a perfect shot by chance; they
                create
                it
                under critical circumstances. On the flip-side, average consumers should not be paying thousands of
                dollars to document a simple event.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tip: If you happen to have your event or photoshoot fall in the slow season, do not hesitate
                negotiate the rate with the photographer. Most freelance photographers will be able to offer some
                discounts depending on the circumstances.
            </p>
            <p>
                At Viji Photography, we strive to strike the right balance
                between professionalism and value. That is why we encourage all of our potential clients to meet us
                for a coffee or tea to evaluate our work. Ask us to show you the sample prints. We will be happy to
                do that for you. Also, you get to know our personalities and creative styles to see whether that
                would be your interest. At the same time, if we feel that we may not deliver justice to your
                hard-earned
                dollars, we will certainly recommend one of our colleagues who can fulfil such requirements.
            </p>
            <h2>Photographer: Preparing for the Assignment</h2>
            <p>
                Prepare, practice and test shoot before every session. Remember failing to plan is simply planning
                to fail. Know your gear and its limitations. Never be
                afraid to take the baby step since everyone has to take it at some point anyways. Oddly, we find
                most amazing photographers are too humble at heart.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Connect with Your Subject</h3>
                    <p> know your subject and make them at ease; that is the key to a great shot. Authentic
                        expression
                        will bring life to any portrait.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>As an Artist, Lead by Example</h3>
                    </p>Since you’re the artist and clients are the subject, just be polite and courteous even when
                    they fail to corporate with you. Innocently, that may happen time to time.
                    <p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Just Make it Happen</h3>
                    </p>Most often journalists do not have the opportunity to frame the perfect shot or dial the
                    correct
                    exposure. It the subject and the story that matters.
                    <p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Creatively Solve Problems</h3>
                    </p>Always choose appropriate lens for the session as well as subject presentation. Try to
                    de-emphasize any flaws artistically in camera if possible.
                    <p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Be Optimistic at All Times</h3>
                    </p>Perfect background is not always possible, just work with your available options and be
                    creative as you can. Be assured that not all days are rainbows and sun shines.
                    <p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Utilize the Power of Nature</h3>
                    </p>Take advantage of natural light by analyzing light direction, amount and quality of light as
                    well as any reflections that brings to the subject.
                    <p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Place Yourself in Shoes of the Subject</h3>
                    </p>Most often flash makes subjects uncomfortable but it is a requirement depending on the
                    circumstances. Use just enough amount of flash as needed for exposure. Also that would help you
                    protect the skin tones.
                    <p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Manage the Unnatural Shadows</h3>
                    </p>Avoid shadows under eyes, necks and clothes particularly in group shots where it is prone to
                    happen when using flash. Do not hesitate to move subjects or light source if practical.
                    <p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Always Protect the highlights</h3>
                    </p>Always protect the highlights since that is difficult to recover in post while managing the
                    shadows, perfect exposure is always subjective to the scene.
                    <p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Experintment With Exposure in Post and Print</h3>
                    </p>Shoot for the highlights and print for the shadows - well established practice. Only
                    extensive experimentation and practice can help to you find your sweet spot.
                    <p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Think Outside the Box</h3>
                    </p>Avoid common point shoot perspectives to add interest to your photography, clients will be
                    thankful and appreciate your creative efforts.
                    <p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Smiling is Not Everything</h3>
                    </p>Remember that smiling is one of the many expressions, depending on the client and the
                    assignment, try to be
                    creative
                    as possible.
                    <p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Be Cautious with Social Media</h3>
                    </p>Positive feedback is encouranging but negative comments can be hurtful. For a beginners, it
                    is best to start slow within your close circles.
                    <p>
                </li>
                <ul />

                <p>Be patient with yourself, you will get there eventually. Keeping practicing, do not compare
                    yourself to anyone. Remember, thousand miles of journey start with a single step. Keep pushing
                    the wheel, find inspirations and photographers that you feel would help you achieve more in your
                    work. We look up to Sean Tucker, a popular youtuber, photographer and film maker based in
                    London, United Kingdom. He is not just a great artist but a finest human being who crossed our
                    minds. Particularly, his film on “Protect Your Highlights: A Lesson for Light and Life” a heart
                    melting motivator for every aspiring photographer.
                </p>

                <h2>Creativity: Industry Standards </h2>
                <p>Being a photographer is just what appears on the surface but indeed post production is what makes
                    a photographer stand out in the crowd and identifies as an artist. Beyond doubt, Adobe is the
                    industry standard for creative professionals but there are more options. Regardless of the tool,
                    just master the art. It is a long process but you will not be disappointed if artistry is your
                    thing. If schooling is not practical, try to study online, plenty of artists and materials
                    available online. Of course, Google is your friend.</p>
                <p>There to too many tutorials but all focuses on adding or changing colors, indeed, in professional
                    photography, it is the opposite. The key is to get it right in camera and then use subtraction
                    method to clean up the image before adding any creative colors or filters. Majority of the time
                    spent in appropriate color balancing for the scene. Refrain from touching saturation, vibration
                    or any color altering techniques till bringing the photo to appropriate exposure, highlight and
                    shadow levels. </p>
                <p>Whenever practical, shoot and process photos with color theory in mind and crop appropriately to
                    make the subject stand out. Use complementary colors in opposite spectrum of the color wheel.
                    Make photos stand out through revealing the mood, environment and situations. The purpose of
                    entire color work is to mimic the natural
                    environment with little artistic touch for pleasing look. In post, we always strive for
                    authentic expressions and realistic sceneries.
